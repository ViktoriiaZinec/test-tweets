## Description

Tweets implemented by scratch on vite.js. It contains 2 pages - Home and Tweets. I've learned web development in GoIT for 3 month so don't expect too much from the source code but I put a lot of effort into implementing all the requirements of the technical specification.

## About the project.

- This app is implemented in React.js and my personal backend for development was created using the UI service mockapi.io.
- The project utilizes the following libraries: axios for making HTTP requests, react-select for a customizable dropdown/select component, and react-loader-spinner to display loading spinners while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.
- The routing is implemented using React Router, which indeed provides powerful navigation features such as links and the ability to navigate between routes programmatically.
- The "Go back" button is created using the useLocation hook provided by React Router. The useLocation hook allows to access the current location object, which contains information about the current URL.

### CSS

- All styles are implemented using CSS Modules, which allows applying styles to specific elements within the component without worrying about global naming conflicts.
