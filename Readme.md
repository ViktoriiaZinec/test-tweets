## Description
<p align="center">

Tweets implemented by scratch on vue.js. It contains 2 pages - Home and Tweets. I've learned web development in GoIT for 3 month so don't expect too much from the source code but I put a lot of effort into implementing all the requirements of the technical specification.

## About the project.

- This app is implemented in React.js and my personal backend for development was created using the UI service mockapi.io.
- Libraries like Vue.draggable were not used as i had to write most of the drag and drop logic according to the solitaire game type and I also had to **MOVE** the stack of cards.
- Ghost image in drag is removed instead the **whole stack** of card moves with cursor change.

### CSS

- Each and every card is 100% css except the SVG of the suit in the center of the card,which is made by illustrator tool.

## Project setup

```
npm install
npm run dev
